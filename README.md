## Focus Areas
- Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning  
- End-to-end ML workflows and experimentation  
- Real-world data analysis and modeling  
- Teaching, mentoring, and concept breakdown  

---

## What I Do
I work on machine learning problems by building complete pipelines from exploration and modeling to evaluation and interpretation.  
Alongside this, I actively teach and mentor, because explaining concepts is how I deepen my own understanding.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of **practice, experimentation, and education**.

---

## What You’ll Find Here
- Machine learning and data science projects  
- Clean notebooks with structured workflows  
- Business-focused analytics work  
- Teaching-oriented explanations alongside code  

---

## Content & Teaching
I share practical ML learning and explanations through:
- **YouTube:** applied ML concepts and walkthroughs
