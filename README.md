## About Me

I care deeply about **how models actually learn**, not just how to use them.

My work lives at the intersection of **Deep Learning, real-world data, and teaching**.  
I build end-to-end ML systems, experiment relentlessly, and spend a large part of my time explaining complex ideas until they become simple.

Teaching is not a side activity for me — it is how I sharpen my own understanding.

## What I Focus On

- Applied Deep Learning and Machine Learning  
- End-to-end ML pipelines and experimentation  
- Learning by building and validating with real data  
- Teaching, mentoring, and explaining concepts clearly  
- Translating theory into practice

## Philosophy

Build things.  
Understand them deeply.  
Teach what you learn.  
Repeat.
