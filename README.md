# Hey, I’m Darshan 👋

I love teaching, I enjoy breaking things down until they *actually make sense*, and I’m deeply curious about how deep learning models learn, fail, and improve.

I work at the intersection of **real-world data, machine learning practice, and education** — building projects, experimenting with models, and sharing what I learn through teaching and content.

## What I’m about
- 🧠 Exploring Deep Learning beyond theory  
- 📊 Turning messy data into useful insights  
- 🧪 Building end-to-end ML pipelines  
- 🎓 Teaching and mentoring (because learning sticks when you explain it)
- 🚀 Constantly experimenting, refining, and learning in public
